## Creating the first book

When you sign in by the first time the sheet will be empty,
and you will be asked to create the first book by using the wizard.

If the ISBN search is available, you can search the book you
want to add by typing the ISBN. If the book exists and the code
is valid, you will be taken to the next step with some fields of
the formulary already filled.

![First step: ISBN search.](/images/new-book-step-01.jpg)

The ISBN used to search can be typed with or without the dashes,
and the search also works with old books that have the ISBN
with 10 digits. However, at the moment, the search will only
work with Brazilian books that have the ISBN starting with
**978-85** or **978-65**.

If the search returns no results or the book don't have a
Brazilian ISBN, you can use the **Fill manually** option.

![Second step: fill the book's metadata.](/images/new-book-step-02.jpg)

The book metadata not always is right or follow a pattern, so
you will probably need to fix some minor issues at the data.
In the image above the manga had it title and author filled
with upper case characters, and needs to be fixed.

## The book metadata

  by the search is incorrect and the tool will perform a fix,
  but you may still need to modify it manually.

  (such as "books", "comics" or "manga"), you can also use
  the name of the franchise in cases with multiple volumes.

  You must always manually fill this metadata.

  a maximum of one digit in the decimal place.
