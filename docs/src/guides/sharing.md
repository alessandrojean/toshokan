# Sharing

You can view the collection of other accounts if they share the
sheet file in Google Drive with your account, or have defined
the file visibility to public.

## Sharing the sheet

Follow the steps above to share the sheet with other account:

1. Find the sheet file in your Google Drive.
2. Click with the right button and choose the **Share** option.
3. Add the e-mails of the Google Accounts.

If you define an account as editor, the person will be able to
view and edit your books. This is a good use case if you have
a shared collection. If it's not the case, we recommend let
the other accounts role only as reader to avoid problems.

For more information on how to do it on other devices,
check the article in [Google Drive Help].

## Viewing a shared sheet

If anyone shared their collection with your account, you need
to find the file in your Google Drive and mark it with a star,
to make it more easier to be found by the app.

To change the current sheet, follow the steps above:

1. Navigate to Dashboard.
2. Click on the **Change sheet** button.
3. Choose another sheet and click on the **Select** button.

After changing, the data will be synced. If you are viewing a sheet
from another account, the profile picture of the person will appear
in some locations, to let it clear which sheet you're viewing.

## Removing the access

To remove the access from other accounts, follow the same steps
from the [Sharing the sheet](#sharing-the-sheet) section and remove
the accounts you don't want anymore.
