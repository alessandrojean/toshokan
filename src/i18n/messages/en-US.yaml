    title: Perfect to also manage your book and comic book collection
    description: >
      Toshokan was initially created with the purpose of managing
      a manga collection, but since the sheet is created in a generic way,
      it also allows the creation of other printed medias, such as books
      and comic books.

      By filling the catalographic record of each item, you will permit
      that filters can be used in the collection to a better organization
      of the sheet contents.

        title: What is an ISBN?
        body: >
          The ISBN is an international book identification system that
          gives a unique numeric identifier for each item, allowing the
          classification by title, authors, country, publisher and edition.

          This code can be normally found next to the barcode. The search
          accepts both versions of the code, the 10-digit and the 13-digit.
          Books recently published usually have a 13-digit version.

          If the book does not have an ISBN, you can manually fill in the
          information needed to create the item in the spreadsheet.
